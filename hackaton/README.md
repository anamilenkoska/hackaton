# 2Park - Driver Assistance

2Park is a web application that helps drivers find available parking spots and reserve them in real-time using an interactive map. Users can view how many spots are available on a given parking lot, the price, opening hours and other crucial information. They can make instant reservations, and receive live updates as spaces become free or occupied. The platform also allows users to report issues such as improper or illegal parking, helping improve parking efficiency and enforcement. Ideal for urban areas, 2Park not only reduces the time spent searching for parking, but also provides driving assistance that enhances convenience and safety.
